# 2025.11.12 - Journal Review Tool Specification

## Overview
Created comprehensive specification for a new Rust CLI tool called "jrnrvw" (Journal Review Tool) to analyze task journal files across directory trees.

## Tasks Completed

### Project Setup
- Created new subdirectory `jrnrvw/` for future tool implementation
- Created `wrk_docs/` directory for documentation storage
- Created `wrk_jrn/` directory for work journals (this file!)

### Specification Document
Created detailed specification document: `wrk_docs/2025.11.12 - Journal Review Tool Specification.md`

**Key Features Specified:**
1. **File Discovery**
   - Recursive search for journal files matching pattern `yyyy.mm.dd - JRN - *.md`
   - Date extraction from filenames
   - Git repository boundary detection

2. **Content Analysis**
   - Markdown parsing
   - Task identifier extraction (GitHub issues, JIRA tickets, custom formats)
   - Activity extraction from journal entries

3. **Grouping & Organization**
   - Primary hierarchy: Repository → Task → Journal Entries
   - Support for nested repositories
   - Handling of ungrouped entries

4. **Time Range Filtering**
   - Predefined ranges: last week, last month, this week, this month
   - Custom date ranges (from/to)
   - Activity-based filtering (last N active days)
   - Distinction between calendar days and actual activity days

5. **Output Formats**
   - Text (default with tree structure)
   - JSON (structured data export)
   - Markdown (report generation)
   - HTML (future enhancement)
   - Summary mode for quick overviews

### Technical Design

**Architecture Components:**
- File Scanner Module (directory traversal, pattern matching)
- Parser Module (markdown, task extraction)
- Analyzer Module (grouping, filtering, statistics)
- Formatter Module (output rendering)
- CLI Module (argument parsing with clap)

**Key Dependencies:**
- `clap` for CLI
- `chrono` for date handling
- `walkdir` for directory traversal
- `pulldown-cmark` for markdown parsing
- `serde/serde_json` for JSON output
- `colored` for terminal output

**Data Structures:**
- JournalFile, JournalEntry, Repository
- TaskReference with TaskType enum (GitHub, Jira, Custom, Heading)
- AnalysisResult with grouping hierarchy
- Summary statistics

### Implementation Plan
Outlined 5-phase implementation:
1. Core functionality (scanning, basic CLI, text output)
2. Enhanced analysis (task extraction, date filtering)
3. Output formats (JSON, markdown, HTML)
4. Advanced features (task merging, search, config)
5. Polish & optimization (performance, shell completions, docs)

## Design Decisions

### Journal File Format
- Chose markdown for human readability
- Date-first naming for easy sorting
- "JRN" identifier for clear categorization
- Flexible description field for context

### Grouping Strategy
- Repository as primary group (matches typical workflow)
- Task as secondary group (tracks work across time)
- Chronological within groups
- Separate ungrouped entries section

### Time Filtering Philosophy
- Both calendar-based and activity-based options
- Activity-based filters exclude gaps (weekends, vacations)
- Useful for "show me the last 7 days I actually worked"

### Task Identification
- Support multiple formats (GitHub, JIRA, custom)
- Regex-based extraction for flexibility
- Future config file for custom patterns
- Handle multiple tasks per journal entry

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve specification
2. Set up Rust project structure in `jrnrvw/` directory
3. Implement Phase 1 (core functionality)
4. Create test fixtures and unit tests
5. Iterate based on real-world usage

## Reflections
- The tool addresses a real need for developers maintaining work journals
- Grouping by repo→task mirrors natural mental model
- Activity-based filtering is particularly useful for retrospectives
- JSON output enables integration with other tools
- Future AI analysis could provide valuable insights

## Time Investment
- Specification writing: ~30 minutes
- Research and design: ~15 minutes
- Documentation: ~10 minutes
- **Total: ~55 minutes**
