## Security Considerations for Automated Trading

### API Key Management

**Best Practices:**
1. **Limited Permissions:** Use read-only keys for data, trading-only for execution
2. **IP Whitelisting:** Restrict API access to specific IPs
3. **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate API keys
4. **Environment Variables:** Never hardcode keys in source code
5. **2FA:** Enable two-factor authentication on accounts

### Non-Custodial Bots

**Recommendation:** Prefer bots that don't hold funds (like Hummingbot)
- API keys should have withdrawal disabled
- Trading permission only
- 2FA on exchange account

### Platform Security Rankings

**Most Secure:**
1. Coinbase (extensive security measures, U.S. regulated)
2. Interactive Brokers (institutional-grade security)
3. Charles Schwab (major bank backing)
4. Alpaca (modern security practices)

**Exercise Caution:**
- Newer platforms with limited track record
- Platforms without 2FA
- Non-regulated exchanges

## Critical Limitations & Warnings

### 1. Interactive Brokers Nightly Reset

**Issue:** IBKR boots all clients nightly for system reset
**Impact:** **Unacceptable for 24/7 automated systems**
**Workaround:** Implement reconnection logic, or avoid for always-on strategies

### 2. Rate Limits

All platforms have rate limits:
- **Alpaca:** 200 req/min
- **Tradier/TD Ameritrade (historical):** 120 req/min
- **IBKR:** 50 orders/sec (high)

**Strategy:** Design systems to respect rate limits, implement request throttling

### 3. Authentication Expiry

- **Schwab:** Weekly re-authentication required
- **Most platforms:** OAuth tokens expire (implement refresh logic)

### 4. API Versioning

- **Alpaca v1→v2 migration:** Caused downtime and issues (2021)
- **Always:** Monitor deprecation notices, test version upgrades

### 5. Market Data Costs

While execution may be free, real-time market data often costs:
- Exchange fees at IBKR
- Subscription at Polygon.io ($199/month)
- Cheaper alternative: FMP ($19/month)

### 6. Regulatory Changes

- TD Ameritrade API shutdown due to Schwab merger
- Binance restrictions in various jurisdictions
- Prop firm restrictions for U.S. citizens

**Recommendation:** Don't build entire system around single provider; have backup plans
