# 2025.11.13 - Journal: jrnrvw Specification Creation

## Task
Create specification for jrnrvw (Journal Review) tool - a Rust CLI application for finding and analyzing task journal files.

## Session Start
Time: 2025-11-13
Project: jrnrvw
Repo: /home/md/language/experiment/jrnrvw

## Activities

### Setup
- Created project directory structure
- Created wrk_docs/ for specifications
- Created wrk_jrn/ for work journals

### Requirements Analysis
Journal file format:
- Naming pattern: `yyyy.mm.dd - JRN - <description>.md`
- Files stored in tree structure below current directory
- Need to parse and group by repository and task

Key features needed:
- Recursive file discovery
- Date-based filtering (last week, last N days of activity)
- Grouping by repository
- Grouping by task within repository
- Time range analysis options
- CLI interface

### Design Considerations
- Tool written in Rust for performance and reliability
- Command-line interface for ease of use
- Support for multiple time range options
- Should handle git repositories intelligently
- Need to parse markdown structure for task identification

### Specification Writing
- Created comprehensive 16-section specification document
- Defined complete CLI interface with all options and arguments
- Specified multiple output formats (text, markdown, JSON, HTML, CSV)
- Documented technical architecture and module structure
- Included data models and key algorithms
- Added use cases and examples
- Defined testing strategy
- Outlined future enhancement roadmap
- Estimated 4-5 week timeline for implementation

### Implementation Planning
- Reviewed specification document in detail
- Created comprehensive multistage implementation plan
- Defined 7 major implementation stages:
  - Stage 0: Project Setup (0.5 days)
  - Stage 1: Core Data Models and Foundation (1.5 days)
  - Stage 2: File Discovery and Basic Parsing (2 days)
  - Stage 3: Analysis, Filtering, and Grouping (2 days)
  - Stage 4: Output Formatters and CLI (2.5 days)
  - Stage 5: Advanced Features and Configuration (1.5 days)
  - Stage 6: Testing and Quality Assurance (2 days)
  - Stage 7: Documentation and Release (1.5 days)
- Total estimated duration: 4-5 weeks
- Each stage includes detailed tasks, deliverables, and acceptance criteria
- Documented dependencies between stages
- Added risk management section
- Created success metrics and testing matrix
- Planned post-release roadmap (v1.1, v1.5, v2.0)

## Deliverables
- `wrk_docs/2025.11.13 - jrnrvw tool specification.md` - Comprehensive tool specification
- `wrk_docs/2025.11.13 - PLN - jrnrvw multistage implementation.md` - Detailed implementation plan
- `wrk_jrn/2025.11.13 - JRN - jrnrvw spec creation.md` - Work journal for this session

## Summary
Successfully created both specification and implementation plan for the jrnrvw (Journal Review) tool.

**Specification Highlights:**
- Complete feature set for journal file discovery and analysis
- Flexible time-range filtering including activity-based windows
- Grouping by repository and task
- Multiple output formats (text, markdown, JSON, HTML, CSV)
- Rust-based architecture with modular design
- CLI interface with extensive options
- Configuration file support
- Testing and documentation strategy

**Implementation Plan Highlights:**
- 7-stage development approach
- 110+ specific implementation tasks
- Detailed acceptance criteria for each stage
- Risk management and mitigation strategies
- Resource requirements and timeline estimates
- Comprehensive testing matrix
- Clear milestones and deliverables

## Time Spent
Approximately 2.5 hours total
- Specification: 1.5 hours
- Implementation planning: 1 hour

## Session Complete
All tasks completed successfully. Both specification and implementation plan are ready for development phase to begin.
