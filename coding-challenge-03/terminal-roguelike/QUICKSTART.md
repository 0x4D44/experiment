## Key Tips

- **Green 'g'** = Goblin (easy)
- **Orange 'o'** = Orc (medium)
- **Brown 'T'** = Troll (hard)
- **Red 'D'** = Dragon (very hard!)

- **/** = Weapon (increases attack)
- **[** = Armor (increases defense)
- **!** = Potion (heals HP immediately)

- Gray areas = Explored but not currently visible
- Dark areas = Unexplored

## Winning Strategy

1. Kill goblins in the first few levels to gain XP
2. Always equip the best weapon and armor you find
3. Don't waste potions - save them for tough fights
4. Level up before going deeper
5. The deeper you go, the higher your score!

Have fun, and good luck in the dungeon!
