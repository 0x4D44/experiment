# SOP Outline – Reverse Engineering Contribution Guidelines

**Status:** Outline (Stage 0)
**Owners:** RE Lead, Tooling Engineer

## Purpose
Provide analysts with consistent expectations for working inside the Ghidra + Binary Ninja toolchain. This outline captures upcoming sections to be filled in during Stage 1 once exporter scripts and templates exist.

## Planned Sections
1. **Prerequisites & Tool Versions** – Installing Ghidra 11.x, Java 17, Binary Ninja 4.x, Python 3.12.
2. **Workspace Setup** – Cloning repo, enabling Git LFS, syncing `re/` artifacts.
3. **Ghidra Workflow** – Project template usage, analyzer toggles, naming conventions, comment format, subsystem tagging.
4. **Binary Ninja Workflow** – Running loader plugin, importing symbols, generating HLIL.
5. **Artifact Refresh Process** – Invoking `scripts/re/refresh_artifacts.py`, reviewing diffs, troubleshooting.
6. **Review & Quality Gates** – Pull request checklist, artifact diff expectations, telemetry trace linkage.
7. **CI & Telemetry** – Reference `.github/workflows` docs, Binary Ninja license handling, telemetry capture SOP (to be linked to `re/docs/ci.md` and `re/docs/telemetry_harness.md`).

Detailed content will be authored during Stage 1 alongside the final SOP.
