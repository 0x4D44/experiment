## 1. The Developer: Geoff Crammond

### Background and Education
- **Education:** Physics degree, which would prove instrumental in creating realistic physics simulations
- **Early Career:** Former defence industry systems engineer at Marconi, where he learned Fortran programming
- **Entry into Gaming:** Transitioned to game development in the early 1980s
- **Personal Note:** Claimed to have had little interest in motor racing before creating his first racing game

### Career Timeline and Notable Works

#### Early Games (1981-1984)
- **Super Invaders (1981):** His first game for the BBC Micro
- **Aviator (1984):** A Spitfire simulator released by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro in March 1984
- **Revs (1984):** His first motor racing simulator - a Formula Three simulator that debuted on the BBC Micro platform

#### Mid-Career Success (1986-1989)
- **The Sentinel (1986):** A critically acclaimed 3D puzzle game published by Firebird on the BBC Micro, featuring 10,000 levels. The game was both a critical and commercial success
- **Stunt Car Racer (1989):** Developed for the Atari ST computer, this title was critically acclaimed and won multiple awards after its release

#### The Grand Prix Series Era (1991-2002)
Since the early 1990s, Crammond's primary focus shifted to developing the award-winning Formula One Grand Prix series:
- **Formula One Grand Prix (F1GP/World Circuit)** - 1991 (Amiga), 1992 (PC/DOS)
- **Grand Prix 2** - 1996 (after 3 years in development)
- **Grand Prix 3** - 2000
- **Grand Prix 4** - 2002 (final entry in the series)

### Career Conclusion
Geoff Crammond's career unceremoniously ended in 2002 when his studio was shut down by Infogrames and the Xbox version of Grand Prix 4 was cancelled just prior to release. He hasn't been credited on a video game since 2002, yet he's arguably one of the most talented designers and programmers the industry has ever seen.

- **Corner Handling:** Drivers could easily experience differences in handling depending on how they entered a corner and when they accelerated out
- **Tire Wear Modeling:** Detailed tire degradation throughout races
  - Qualifying tires were an extreme example - players couldn't drive more than a couple of laps without losing grip and spinning on nearly every corner
- **Realistic Wet Weather:** A first for 3D racing games
- **Real-World Physics:** Among the first games to implement something resembling "real world" racing physics alongside accurate track modeling

#### Car Setup and Tuning
In-race setup allowed players to adjust critical parameters during pit stops:
- Gear ratios

- Wing downforce
- Tire selection

#### Innovative Driving Aids
F1GP introduced assistance tools that would become standard in racing games for the next 20+ years:
- **Brake Assistance:** Automatically applied brakes in time for corners
- **Ideal Line Display:** Visual guide on the tarmac to help learn track layouts
- **Optimal Gear Suggestions:** Recommendations for the best gear selection
- **Scalable Difficulty:** The game covered playability from pure arcade-racer level up to the most advanced sim-level available at the time, depending on which driving assistances were activated
