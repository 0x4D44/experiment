# Fixture Assets

This directory contains open-source fixtures used for automated tests, tooling smoke-tests, and CI runs
where we cannot ship the original MicroProse assets. The fixtures are intentionally synthetic so they can
be published in this repository.

## Contents

- `track_stub.bin` – A deterministic synthetic DAT track generated by the `generate_fixtures` binary.
- `driver_db.json` – Sanitized subset of the 1991 driver/car database copied from `data/samples`.
- `telemetry/synthetic_monaco.bin` – Tiny telemetry capture (player + AI sample) used by tooling tests and parity harness smoke checks.

## Regenerating Fixtures

Run the helper binary (or wrapper script) whenever fixture formats change:

```bash
cargo run --quiet --bin generate_fixtures
# or
./scripts/build_fixtures.sh
```

Both commands create `data/fixtures/track_stub.bin` and copy the sanitized driver DB. The script prints the
resulting file sizes, which CI parses to ensure the fixtures exist before tests execute.

## CI Integration

- Always run `scripts/build_fixtures.sh` (or the binary directly) before CI jobs that rely on parser/loader tests.
- Tests should reference data under `data/fixtures` to avoid touching proprietary payloads.
- The fixtures are git-ignored to keep noise out of commits; regenerating them locally is inexpensive.

## Legal Note

These artifacts never include original MicroProse assets. They are scratch files derived from open data so they can
circulate in public CI systems.
