**Date:** 2025-11-17
**Phase:** Post Phase 1 - Documentation & Next Steps
**Status:** 🚧 IN PROGRESS

---

## Current State

### ✅ Completed (Last 3.5 hours)
- Single f1gp binary (3.0 MB)
- Menu system (Main, Track Select, Pause)
- 15 authentic F1GP tracks loaded
- 3 AI opponents
- Complete game loop
- All committed and pushed

### 📊 Progress Toward Goals

**Original Goal:**
> Single exe "f1gp" with menu system, 2.5D graphics, original game files

**Status:**
- ✅ Single f1gp binary
- ✅ Menu system
- ✅ Original .DAT files
- ⏳ 2D rendering (not 2.5D isometric yet)
- ❌ No sound

**Completion:** ~60% toward v1.0

---

## Session Goals

1. Update README to reflect new binary
2. Document how to run f1gp
3. Plan next phase
4. Consider: 2.5D rendering vs sound vs polish

### Step 2: Planning Next Phase ⏳

**Goal:** Decide on next development priority

**Options Analysis:**

1. **2.5D Isometric Rendering** 🎯 PRIMARY GOAL
   - This is the main missing piece for v1.0
   - Original F1GP used isometric perspective
   - Would bring us from 60% → 90%+ completion
   - Requires: camera projection, sprite transformation, depth sorting
   - Estimated effort: Medium-High

2. **Sound System**
   - Engine sounds, effects, menu sounds
   - Would enhance experience but not core to v1.0
   - Estimated effort: Medium

3. **Polish & UI Improvements**
   - Better HUD, telemetry displays
   - Track mini-map
   - Estimated effort: Low-Medium

**Recommendation:** Focus on **2.5D Isometric Rendering** as it's the primary goal and the largest gap to v1.0.
