## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Audio Synthesis
```rust
// Real-time sound generation (48kHz, mono)
Engine:      Sawtooth wave + 3 harmonics
Gear Shift:  White noise burst with envelope
Tire Squeal: High-frequency filtered noise (sliding-based)
Collision:   Noise + 80 Hz sine (impact thump)
Menu Beep:   440 Hz sine wave
```

### Isometric Projection
```rust
// 30° camera angle transformation
iso_x = (world.x - world.z) * 0.866  // cos(30°)
iso_y = (world.x + world.z) * 0.5 - world.y  // sin(30°)
```

### Performance
- Lock-free audio callback (Arc<Mutex<>> with state copying)
- Depth sorting only when needed (isometric mode)
- Efficient SDL2 rendering
- < 5% CPU for audio synthesis
