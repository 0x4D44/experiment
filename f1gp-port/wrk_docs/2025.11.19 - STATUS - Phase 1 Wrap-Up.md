# 2025-11-19 – Status: Phase 1 Data Foundation Wrap-Up

## Completed Deliverables
- **Track ingestion:** `TrackAsset` struct + parser populates offsets, racing line, sections; checksum validation wired through tooling.
- **Asset workflows:** `asset_extractor`, `audio_ui_extractor`, README/CONTRIBUTING instructions, `docs/data_pipeline.md`, CI script regenerating sanitized fixtures.
- **Driver DB:** Runtime loads sanitized `driver_db.json` via env override; fixtures & docs updated.
- **Telemetry:** Runtime capture, schema spec, `telemetry_cli` (summary/export/diff), parity harness outline + DOS capture playbook, synthetic telemetry fixtures.
- **Tooling & docs:** `docs/dos_capture_playbook.md`, `docs/parity_harness.md`, `wrk_docs/...` design + plan artifacts.

## Outstanding Items (Phase 1 Scope)
1. **Racing-line metadata schema (Task 1.2):** need standalone conversion CLI + JSON schema linking parsed commands to AI/planner (current parser stores `RacingLine` but no exporter/docs).
2. **Legal fixture coverage (Task 1.6 full exit):** sanitized audio/font manifests exist, but CI still relies on contributors running scripts manually; integrate `scripts/run_ci.sh` into actual CI pipeline.
3. **DOS capture automation (Task 1.8 stretch):** playbook exists, but we still need DOS serial parser + artifact bucket for reference logs; parity harness currently compares CSVs only when manually exported.

## Phase 2 Readiness
Before kicking off rendering/UI parity tasks:
- Confirm resource availability for sprite pipeline (need legal sprite inputs or authoring spec).
- Decide asset format for VGA fonts/sprites (tie into audio/UI extractor outputs).
- Lock telemetry diff thresholds with QA to prevent churn in later phases.

## TODO Hotspots Worth Tracking
- `src/render/car_renderer.rs`: sprite rendering placeholder (needs atlas integration once 2.1 lands).
- `src/render3d/renderer.rs` + `src/render/track_renderer.rs`: camera/object TODOs tied to future phases.
- `src/game/state.rs` HUD delta calculation pending once lap history stored.

## Next Actions
1. Finish Task 1.2 by exporting racing-line metadata + documentation.
2. Prototype sprite atlas generator + runtime loader (Phase 2.1) once sanitized assets available.
3. Build DOS serial parser + integrate with `telemetry_cli diff` for automated parity thresholds.
