# Code Review Plan (2025-11-20)

## Scope Identification
- Core game crate in `src/`: data loading/parsing, fixtures, physics, AI, game state/session/input, rendering (2D + 3D), audio, platform SDL2 wrapper, utils, binaries (`f1gp`, `test_parser`, `parity_harness`, `generate_fixtures`).
- Workspace tools: `asset_extractor`, `audio_ui_extractor`, `racing_line_cli`, `track_viewer`, `track_inspector`, `telemetry_cli`, `sprite_atlas_cli`, `3d_demo`, `graphics_test`, `playable_demo`, `dos_capture_parser`.
- Scripts & CI: `scripts/run_ci.sh`, fixture builders, sprite/CSV generators; data/fixtures and docs.
- Tests: unit tests co-located; integration tests in `tests/` with fixtures.

## Review Tracks
1) **Data & Fixtures** — parsers, loaders, schema expectations, safety around memmap/byteorder, fixture generation paths.  
2) **Physics & AI** — correctness, determinism, parameterization, edge cases (collisions, weather, racing line).  
3) **Game Loop & State** — session lifecycle, input handling, telemetry capture, error handling/logging.  
4) **Rendering (2D/3D) & Platform** — camera math, sprite atlases, HUD, wgpu/SDL2 setup, resource lifetimes.  
5) **Audio** — engine synthesis, sound mixer, optional feature gating.  
6) **Tools** — parity/telemetry CLIs, asset extractors, demo binaries; argument validation and file I/O safety.  
7) **Build, Style, CI** — fmt/clippy expectations, scripts, feature flags, test coverage and gaps.  
8) **Security & Data Handling** — avoidance of copyrighted assets, path handling, env overrides, clean-room constraints.

## Method
- Read code per area, noting defects, undefined behaviors, safety issues, API clarity, and test coverage.  
- Record findings with severity (High/Med/Low), location, rationale, and recommendation.  
- Note missing tests or docs; suggest targeted tests and guard rails.  
- Summarize overall risks and quick wins; keep report concise with actionable steps.
