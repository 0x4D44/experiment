# HLIL Reference

This directory mirrors the contents of `re/artifacts/hlil/` so gameplay engineers can review lifted subsystems without leaving the main repo. Files are grouped by subsystem (e.g., `physics.c`, `audio.c`). Do not edit generated files directly; instead, update annotations in Ghidra/Binary Ninja and rerun the refresh pipeline.
