# DOS Telemetry Captures

This directory will store deterministic capture bundles generated by the DOSBox-X harness defined in `re/scripts/capture_telemetry.py`. Each capture should include:
- `metadata.json` – runtime parameters, hash of game binary, controller script reference.
- `trace.bin` – raw telemetry output (format TBD, likely Cap'n Proto or binary struct dumps).
- `video.avi` (optional) – reference video when reverse engineering rendering.

During Stage 4 CI, a pared-down sample capture (`sample_boot/metadata.json`) is committed for parity tests until live DOSBox captures are available.
