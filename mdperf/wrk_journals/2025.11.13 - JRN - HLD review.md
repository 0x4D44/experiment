# Work Journal - HLD Review (Rust Benchmarking App)

## 2025-11-13 11:28 UTC
- Created `wrk_journals` folder and initialized this journal per instructions.
- Listed repo contents to locate HLD file under `wrk_docs`.
- Ready to read `2025.11.13 - HLD - rust benchmarking app.md`.

## 2025-11-13 11:29 UTC
- Read the entire HLD draft for the Rust benchmarking app.
- Noted major modules (CLI, TUI, orchestrator, test suites) and execution flow for later critique.
- Identified areas to dig deeper: concurrency model between tokio + std threads, metrics schema, disk/network edge cases.

## 2025-11-13 11:29 UTC (cont.)
- Drafted list of review angles: orchestration vs async runtime, cross-platform file I/O semantics, config coverage per test, reporting schema alignment, and staging timeline realism.
- Preparing final review summary for the user covering strengths, gaps, and open questions.

## 2025-11-13 11:30 UTC
- Captured six review findings (runtime orchestration, config coverage, disk hygiene, reporting/baselines, network automation, schedule risk).
- Ready to send summary to requester and highlight journal location.

## 2025-11-13 14:00 UTC
- Kicked off implementation-plan work derived from the HLD; outlined needed stages and deliverables before drafting the document.

## 2025-11-13 14:01 UTC
- Drafted multistage implementation plan covering five stages, cross-cutting workstreams, and checkpoints.
- Saved plan as `wrk_docs/2025.11.13 - PLN - rust benchmarking rollout.md` and verified contents.

## 2025-11-13 14:02 UTC
- Began deep review of the previously drafted implementation plan; goal is to stress-test schedule, dependencies, and risk coverage before updating the doc.

## 2025-11-13 14:05 UTC
- Completed plan QA: flagged concurrency clarity, baseline timing mismatch, Stage 2 scope risk, and missing risk tracking.
- Updated plan with revision history + review adjustments, split Stage 2 into waves, aligned baseline gating with Stage 3, expanded CI/ADR tasks, and added formal risk register.
