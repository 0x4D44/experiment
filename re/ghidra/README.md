# Ghidra Workspace

This directory will eventually contain the canonical `.gpr` project template, analyzer configuration, exporter scripts, and SOPs for annotating `GP.EXE`.

## Planned Contents
- `project_template/` – Seed project with loader settings and data type libraries.
- `scripts/` – Custom exporters (`ExportSymbolsToJson.java`, etc.) and annotation helpers.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – Naming conventions, review requirements, and analyzer toggles (to be authored during Stage 1).

For now, the template and scripts directories hold placeholders so downstream tooling can reference stable paths.
