# Reverse Engineering Artifacts

All machine-generated outputs from Ghidra/Binary Ninja workflows live here. Example files to be produced in later stages:
- `symbols.json` – Canonical symbol metadata export from Ghidra (includes `source_recording_id` references to telemetry captures).
- `segments.yml` – Segment and overlay layout.
- `hlil/` – HLIL C exports grouped by subsystem.
- `logs/` – Execution logs from automation scripts.
- `telemetry/` – DOSBox capture metadata referenced by `source_recording_id` fields.
  - `telemetry/index.json` – generated by `re/scripts/link_traces.py`, listing capture metadata + trace hashes.

Until automation is in place, directories contain placeholder `.gitkeep` files to ensure the layout exists without committing large binaries.
