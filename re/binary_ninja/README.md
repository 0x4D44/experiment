# Binary Ninja Workspace

Placeholder for loader plugins, import scripts, HLIL export tooling, and workflow automation required to consume `re/artifacts/symbols.json` + `segments.yml`.

## Planned Structure
- `plugins/` – `f1gp_loader.py`, `import_symbols.py`, and related helpers.
- `workflows/` – Saved analysis profiles, headless command wrappers, and documentation.

Stage 2 will populate these directories with actual implementations.
